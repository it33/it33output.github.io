# OpenOps

OpenOps is an open source AI-enhanced chat collaboration sandbox to accelerate responsible evaluation of generative AI models applied to real world workflows. OpenOps:

* Enables AI exploration with full data control in a multi-user pilot.
* Supports broad ecosystem of AI models from OpenAI and Microsoft to open source LLMs from Hugging Face.
* Speeds development of custom security, compliance and data custody policy from early evaluation to future scale.

Unliked closed source, vendor-controlled environments for integration private conversations, workflow and generative AI, OpenOps provides an open source, customer-controlled platform for AI exploration with full data data control.

## Why OpenOps?

Everyone‚Äôs in a race to deploy generative AI solutions, but need to do so in a responsible and safe way. OpenOps lets you run powerful models in a safe sandbox to establish the right safety protocols before rolling out.

- **Step 1:** Set up the OpenOps collaboration sandbox, which is a self-hosted service providing multi-user chat and integration with GenAI. 

- **Step 2:** Evaluate different GenAI providers, from public SaaS services like OpenAI to fully local open source models, based on your security and privacy requirements.

- **Step 3:** Invite select early adopters and trust and safety colleagues to explore and evaluate based on their workflows. Observe behavior and record user feedback, and identify issues. Iterate on workflows and usage policies. Consider issues such as data leakage, legal / copyright, privacy, response correctness and appropriateness.

- **Step 4:** Set and implement policies as availability is incrementally rolled out.

## What does OpenOps include? 

Deploying the OpenOps sandbox includes the following componenents: 
- üè∞ **Mattermost Server** - Open source, self-hosted alternative to Discord and Slack for strict security environments with playbooks/workflow automation, tools integration, real time 1-1 and group messaging, audio calling and screenshare.  
- üìô **PostgreSQL** - Database for storing private data from multi-user, chat collaboration discussions and audit history.    
- ü§ñ **Mattermost AI plugin** - Extension of Mattermost platform for AI bot and generative AI integration. 
- ü¶ô **Open Source, Self-Hosted LLM models** - Models for evaluation and use case development via Hugging Face. 
- üß†  **(Optional) Closed Source, Vendor-Hosted AI models** - SaaS-based GenAI models from Azure AI, OpenAI & Anthropic.  
- üì± **(Optional) Mattermost Mobile and Desktop Apps** - End user apps for future production deployment.
