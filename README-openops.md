# OpenOps

OpenOps is an open source AI-enhanced chat collaboration sandbox to accelerate responsible evaluation of AI models applied to real world workflows. OpenOps:
* Enables AI exploration with full data control in a multi-user pilot.
* Supports broad ecosystem of AI models from OpenAI and Microsoft to open source LLMs from Hugging Face.
* Speeds development of custom security, compliance and data custody policy from early evaluation to future scale.

## Why OpenOps?

Everyoneâ€™s in a race to deploy generative AI solutions, but need to do so in a responsible and safe way. OpenOps lets you run powerful models in a safe sandbox to establish the right safety protocols before rolling out.

Step 1: Set up the OpenOps collaboration sandbox, which is a self-hosted service providing multi-user chat and integration with GenAI. 

Step 2: Evaluate different GenAI providers, from public SaaS services like OpenAI to fully local open source models, based on your security and privacy requirements.

Step 3: Invite select early adopters to explore and evaluate based on their workflows. 

Step 4: Observe behavior and record user feedback, and identify issues. Iterate on workflows and usage policies. Consider issues such as data leakage, legal / copyright, privacy, response correctness and appropriateness.

Step 5: Set and implement policies as availability is incrementally rolled out.
