# Sandbox 

Using ChatGPT4 to make mini-web games. Here's what's working and what prompt were used to get the games written. Note that ChatGPT4 is non-deterministic, so you might get different results using the same prompts. 

1. [Etch-A-Sketch](https://it33.github.io/sandbox/etchasketch.html) - Draw pictures using Arrow keys 

```
Create an HTML page that simulates an "Etch A Sketch" with the arrow key controlling the movement of the cursor. As the cursor moves, leave a trail.
```

2. [Circle Golf](https://it33.github.io/sandbox/golf5.html) - Knock a golf ball into its cup on a circular green. 

```
Create a single HTML file with a 2D golf putting game with a green circular floor, a black hole, and a white golf ball. The arrow keys will control the acceleration of the golf ball along the green surface, up arrow accelerates in x direction and down arrow accelerates in y direction. If the ball hits the edge of the green surface, it should bounce back along the green surface. There should be no movement or acceleration along a third z direction. The game will reset if the ball touches the black hole.

Include instructions.

Fit everything in the HTML file within the character output limit. If needed, change the variable names in the HTML to random two character names so the code will work, even if it's less legible.
```
